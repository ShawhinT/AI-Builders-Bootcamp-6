If prompting and other workarounds are not enough, fine-tuning is a viable option.\n\nAdditionally, this allows you to build specialized models for your specific use case, which can come with significant cost savings.\n\n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\n--\nIf this post was helpful, repost it and follow me (Shaw Talebi) for more :)"}]}

Use Python libs like markdown and weasyprint to export the output resume as a PDF.\n\n2) Upwork Proposal Optimizer (Beginner)\n\n\u274c\u00a0Problem: Struggling to get your first freelance client\n\u2705\u00a0Solution: Have an LLM rewrite your proposal template based on the specific job posting by extracting key pain points and demonstrating how you can solve them based on your experience and portfolio.\n\n3) Meeting Follow-up Writer (Intermediate)\n\n\u274c\u00a0Problem: Meeting follow-up emails are tedious\n\u2705\u00a0Solution: Transcribe a meeting recording using Whisper and have an LLM craft a follow-up email based on a template. Note: If you don\u2019t have a standard follow-up template, you can also have an LLM write that.\n\n4) Upwork Demand Analyzer (Intermediate)\n\n\u274c\u00a0Problem: I don\u2019t know what services to sell\n\u2705\u00a0Solution: Search for jobs that match your skillset, then use a tool like \u201cInstant Data Scraper\u201d to extract the job posting as a .csv file. Next, use text embeddings to cluster jobs and identify areas with the greatest demand.\n\n5) Agentic Email Assistant (Advanced)\n\n\u274c\u00a0Problem: My inbox is a disaster\n\u2705\u00a0Solution: Connect an LLM to your Gmail inbox and have it respond to (or delete) low-priority emails based on past examples in your mailbox\n\nWhich one of these do you want to build?\n\n--\n\ud83d\udc49 If you liked this post, repost it and follow me (Shaw Talebi) for more"}]}

It\u2019s to attract the right customer.\n\n3) Spending zero time on understanding my customer\n\nTo be fair, my messaging was so vague because I didn\u2019t know who my customer was.\n\nThis resulted in a wide range of inquiries from customers across industries, which meant I was starting from zero at the beginning of every new client engagement.\n\nClarifying WHO you want to sell to not only helps avoid this learning curve but allows you to optimize your marketing for your customer.\n\n4) Having an unclear offer\n\nAnother big mistake I made was offering \u201cdata science and AI services\u201d (whatever that means).\n\nIn other words, it wasn\u2019t clear what value I was providing my customer.\n\nA better offer would be something like \u201cI help startups build AI features that make them money\u201d\n\n5) Pricing for time (not value)\n\nHowever, the biggest killer of an unclear offer was that I left money on the table.\n\nI was stuck in the mindset of \u201cI\u2019m a data scientist for hire\u201d with an hourly rate.\n\nIn contrast, if I had focused on solving problems for a particular customer, I could price for the value I generated for them.\n\nThis is an entirely different ballgame because I am no longer capped by my (limited) time, but rather by scale of my customer\u2019s problems.\n\nWhat are some key mistakes you've made on your journey?\n\n--\n\ud83d\udc49 If you liked this post, repost it and follow me (Shaw Talebi) for more."}]}

This is called transfer learning, which typically consists of retraining the last few layers of a model (and maybe adding a new one).\n\nThe key upside of this is that you can significantly improve a model's performance on a novel task without major data and compute costs. \n\nHowever, even this approach can be impractical for very large base models.\n\nBucket 3: New Parameters (i.e. adapters) \ud83d\udcbb \n\nThis final bucket consists of adding a (relatively) small number of trainable parameters to key parts of a model while keeping its original parameters frozen. The technical term for this approach is Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).\n\nA popular PEFT approach is Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), which has made fine-tuning large language models practical for GPU-poor practitioners. \n\nAdditionally, this is a handy approach when working with a relatively small training data set (which is the biggest unlock IMO)."}]}

Resume Matcher (Intermediate) \n\nA common struggle for recruiters and job seekers is finding roles that are a good fit based on skills and experience. \n\nWhile there are many ways to do this, an interesting approach is using text embeddings of resumes and job descriptions and matching them based on similarity. \n\n4. Automated DocString Writer (Intermediate) \n\nOne of the more tedious (yet important) parts of programming is writing docstrings from custom functions. \n\nToday, this can be effectively automated using GPT-4o-mini (or any other LLM) via Openai\u2019s API. \n\n5.

Additionally, having a single mentor for all matters is unlikely. No one has walked the same unique path as you. That's why learning from different people for different topics is often necessary.\n\n2) Paying people for their time\n\nGood mentors are busy and usually don't have time to do coffee chats with strangers on the internet.\n\nA simple hack I've found to bypass this is directly booking time with people 1-2 steps ahead of me. I've done this several times with data science freelancers on Upwork.\n\n3) Growing my personal brand\n\nAnother way to make it easier for mentors to talk to you is to be less of a stranger.\n\nThis is where having a personal brand has helped me. I've done this by sharing YouTube, Medium, and LinkedIn content.\n\nNow, people I'd consider mentors have even contacted me for coffee chats!"}]}

Learn Python \n\nAlthough some say you don\u2019t need to learn to code anymore, I still think it\u2019s essential for anyone who wants to build custom software solutions. \n\n2. Build Projects \n\nThe AI space is too massive and evolving too quickly to effectively learn from a textbook. The best approach (IMO) is to start by building projects and learning concepts as needed. \n\n3. Start with Kaggle/HF Datasets \n\nWhile you\u2019ll never find neatly curated data in the real world, I think using resources like Kaggle or Hugging Face is a great starting place for beginners. \n\nSome libraries worth learning for this initial project are: Pandas (or Polars), matplotlib, and sklearn \n\n4. Find a real-world project \n\nAfter one or two toy projects, it\u2019s time to start working on something more practical. The best projects solve a real-world problem. \n\nI\u2019d seek one out by reaching out to businesses or other orgs in my network to see if I could offer them free work. \n\n5. Use ChatGPT and Cursor \n\nAI coding assistants have become the norm for programming. Use them to help you learn faster and get you unblocked as needed."}]}

"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The excitement (and fear) surrounding AI boils down to one thing \u2014 automation. \n\nWhile we might think that more automation means more efficiency, it can often be the exact opposite. \n\nThis was a painful lesson Elon Musk learned during Tesla\u2019s Model 3 launch, which led him to develop a 5-step algorithm for solving engineering problems. \n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown\u2026 \n\n\ud83d\udccc Step 1: Question Requirements \n\nRequirements\u00a0are the\u00a0constraints one must work within for a project, and more often than not, some are more negotiable than others. \n\nThe goal is to\u00a0make the requirements less dumb. Musk employs two critical questions to do this. One, why is that required? And two, who created that requirement? (Like specifically someone\u2019s name) \n\n\ud83d\udccc Step 2: Delete \n\nWith the requirements a little less dumb, one can begin designing and building the AI system. \n\nDuring this process, there will inevitably be components that, despite careful consideration,\u00a0turn out to be unnecessary when put into the real world. \n\nAs Musk says, \u201cThe best part is no part.\u201d In other words, if a step or module in the system can be removed, then it should be. \n\n\ud83d\udccc Step 3: Simplify or Optimize \n\nDeletion helps distill a system to its key components, but there is often more room for improvement. \n\nFor example, the current design may use a large language model to identify a candidate\u2019s highest level of education or specific keywords. \n\nHowever, this could be replaced with a (much) simpler keyword search over the candidate\u2019s resume. \n\n\ud83d\udccc Step 4: Accelerate \n\nAt this point, we should have a lean and efficient system. The next question to ask ourselves is, \u201cHow can we move faster?\u201d \n\nFor example, if building an AI tool for the HR team, the bottleneck might be slow communication between the recruiter and hiring manager, a lack of user proficiency in the application, or insufficient recruiting staff. \n\n\ud83d\udccc Step 5: Automate \n\nIt\u2019s important to do this step last because\u00a0automation begets scaling. While this might sound like a good thing, scaling a flawed process can be a complete nightmare. \n\nPut another way,\u00a0automation scales not only outputs but also errors. \n\n-- \nI discuss this more in a recent blog post in The Data Entrepreneurs Medium publication. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Check it out here: https://lnkd.in/gepXD4Gg"}]}

I find this is not only a great way to learn but also a great way to\u00a0show\u00a0your skills and competence. \n\n4) LinkedIn (networking) \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbc\u2014 Simply being more active on LinkedIn is a great way to increase your exposure to peers and potential employers. A key point is that you may not necessarily need to develop your skills further. Simply conveying the skills you already have might be enough. \n\n5) Freelancing \ud83e\udd1d\u00a0\u2014 This is a personal favorite for me. Even if you don\u2019t get any contracts, the pace of freelance contracts is much faster than full-time roles. This means you get many more reps fine-tuning your resume, writing cover letters, and doing interviews freelancing than otherwise. \n\n\u2014 \nThank you to Data Science Club at UTDallas for hosting us! It was a pleasure speaking to the next generation of data scientists and meeting the other esteemed panelists!
