""While giving an LLM tools makes it practical, it is still limited because it is forced to perform tasks in a one-shot fashion.""

""""
""Fine-tuning involves adapting a model to a particular use case through additional training.""
""""
""Before doing this, however, we must ask ourselves a fundamental question: which parameters do I want to fine-tune?""
""""
""While there are countless ways to do this, I like to split them into 3 buckets.""
""""
""Bucket 1: All Parameters 🌎 ""
""""
""The simplest approach is to retrain all the parameters in your base model, also called full parameter fine-tuning.""
""""
""This works well when you have a lot of data and want to make fundamental changes to the model’s behavior. ""
""""
""The downside, of course, is that this is the most computationally expensive option and risks the model “forgetting” key abilities.""
""""
""Bucket 2: Some Parameters 🪛 ""
""""
""To mitigate the compute requirements and training risks of full fine-tuning, one can pick a subset of parameters to retrain. This is called transfer learning, which typically consists of retraining the last few layers of a model (and maybe adding a new one).""
""""
""The key upside of this is that you can significantly improve a model's performance on a novel task without major data and compute costs. ""
""""
""However, even this approach can be impractical for very large base models.""
""""
""Bucket 3: New Parameters (i.e. adapters) 💻 ""
""""
""This final bucket consists of adding a (relatively) small number of trainable parameters to key parts of a model while keeping its original parameters frozen. The technical term for this approach is Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).""
""""
""A popular PEFT approach is Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), which has made fine-tuning large language models practical for GPU-poor practitioners. ""
""""
""Additionally, this is a handy approach when working with a relatively small training data set (which is the biggest unlock IMO).",

""1) ""More is better""""
""""
""My biggest mistake was trying to fit every bit of potentially relevant experience into my resume to make me sound more ""qualified"".""
""""
""When it comes to resumes, however, you've only got 7 seconds of someone's attention, so the best strategy is to include only 2 to 3 key points most relevant to the role. (You can talk about your other experiences in the interview.)""
""""
""2) ""I don't need to tailor my resume""""
""""
""For a while, I had a single resume that summarized all my work experience.""
""""
""While this was easy for me, it resulted in a lot of irrelevant points, which made me a less compelling candidate (and jobless).""
""""
""3) ""I need an objective statement""""
""""
""Objective statements are common in resume templates.""
""""
""In my experience, however, the main thing an objective statement accomplishes is ""using up"" a hiring manager's precious attention on low-value information.""
""""
""4) ""Writing down my experience is enough""""
""""
""While skills and experience are the most important part of getting a job, simply writing them down is not enough.""
""""
""How you convey your experience matters. My rule of thumb is to put the important stuff near the top and the less important stuff near the bottom (and remove the unimportant stuff altogether)""

""""
""While we might think that more automation means more efficiency, it can often be the exact opposite. ""
""""
""This was a painful lesson Elon Musk learned during Tesla’s Model 3 launch, which led him to develop a 5-step algorithm for solving engineering problems. ""
""""
""Here’s a breakdown… ""
""""
""📌 Step 1: Question Requirements ""
""""
""Requirements are the constraints one must work within for a project, and more often than not, some are more negotiable than others. ""
""""
""The goal is to make the requirements less dumb. Musk employs two critical questions to do this. One, why is that required? And two, who created that requirement? (Like specifically someone’s name) ""
""""
""📌 Step 2: Delete ""
""""
""With the requirements a little less dumb, one can begin designing and building the AI system. ""
""""
""During this process, there will inevitably be components that, despite careful consideration, turn out to be unnecessary when put into the real world. ""
""""
""As Musk says, “The best part is no part.” In other words, if a step or module in the system can be removed, then it should be. ""
""""
""📌 Step 3: Simplify or Optimize ""
""""
""Deletion helps distill a system to its key components, but there is often more room for improvement. ""
""""
""For example, the current design may use a large language model to identify a candidate’s highest level of education or specific keywords. ""
""""
""However, this could be replaced with a (much) simpler keyword search over the candidate’s resume. ""
""""
""📌 Step 4: Accelerate ""
""""
""At this point, we should have a lean and efficient system. The next question to ask ourselves is, “How can we move faster?” ""
""""
""For example, if building an AI tool for the HR team, the bottleneck might be slow communication between the recruiter and hiring manager, a lack of user proficiency in the application, or insufficient recruiting staff. ""
""""
""📌 Step 5: Automate ""
""""
""It’s important to do this step last because automation begets scaling. While this might sound like a good thing, scaling a flawed process can be a complete nightmare. ""
""""
""Put another way, automation scales not only outputs but also errors. ""

""(This is the same framework I am using right now to learn data engineering and ML engineering 😉) ""

""📚 Step 1: Gather resources - I’d start by making a YouTube playlist of (short) high-level data science videos and curating a list of introductory articles to read. ""
""""
""🎙️Step 2: Set up 10 interviews with data scientists - One of the greatest “hacks” I’ve learned for learning is talking to those ahead of me. Therefore, I’d reach out to people doing data science and ask them questions like: What is DS? How did you get started? What advice do you have for me? (Repeat step 1 as needed) ""
""""
""📊 Step 3: Do a project - Learning from others can only get you so far. Eventually, you need to get your hands on the keyboard and start doing it. If I were completely green, I would start with a super basic project like creating a visualization using data from Kaggle. If I’m starting with some adjacent experience, I will try to grab data from the real world and solve a meaningful problem. (Repeat steps 1-2 as needed) ""
""""
""✍️ Step 4: Teach someone what I learned - Teaching is one of the best ways to solidify knowledge. Once I finished my project, I’d make a YouTube video or write a Medium blog about it (or both). ""

""""
""To help resolve this, here are 5 ways to become a data scientist beyond (prior) work experience 👇 ""
""""
""1) Education 🤓 — Most data scientists I’ve met have some additional training beyond an undergraduate degree. ""
""""
""2) Independent Projects 🧑‍💻— An effective (and cost-free) way to learn is to pursue independent projects you find interesting with data from the real world. ""
""""
""3) Content Creation ✍️ — Make content about data science topics and projects. I find this is not only a great way to learn but also a great way to show your skills and competence. ""
""""
""4) LinkedIn (networking) 🧑‍💼— Simply being more active on LinkedIn is a great way to increase your exposure to peers and potential employers. A key point is that you may not necessarily need to develop your skills further. Simply conveying the skills you already have might be enough. ""
""""
""5) Freelancing 🤝 — This is a personal favorite for me. Even if you don’t get any contracts, the pace of freelance contracts is much faster than full-time roles. This means you get many more reps fine-tuning your resume, writing cover letters, and doing interviews freelancing than otherwise. ""
