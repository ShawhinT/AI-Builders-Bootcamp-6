This is the operational software for refunding orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing transactions, and providing customer support. But most companies don’t have adequate resources to properly invest in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and spreadsheet flows. </p>\n<p>At Retool, we’re on a mission to bring good software to everyone. We’re building a new type of development platform that combines the benefits of traditional software development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that the future of software development lies in abstracting away the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on, while creating reusable components that act as a force multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is not just productivity, but good software by default. And that’s a mission worth striving for. </p>\n<p>Today, our customers span from small startups building their first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their business. Interested in joining us? Let us know! </p><p><strong>WHY WERE LOOKING FOR YOU</strong></p>\n<p>At Retool, our mission is to radically accelerate how software gets built. That mission takes on a new dimension with AI. The rise of LLMs and AI agents doesn’t just make software faster to build—it changes what software is and how it operates.</p>\n<p>With Retool Agents, we’re building the fastest path to AI-powered software in production. Our platform makes it possible to compose agents that don’t just chat—they reason, take action, and interface directly with your business systems. They perform real work.</p>\n<p>But building and deploying these agents—especially in high-stakes, real-world environments—requires a new kind of engineer. That’s where you come in.</p>\n<p>We’re hiring our first Deployed AI Engineer to help our most strategic customers scope, build, and ship production-grade agents on top of Retool. You’ll act as a founding member of a small team at the edge of what’s possible with Retool’s AI platform, working directly with customers, Field Engineering, and our product and infra teams to bring powerful agents to life.</p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE TEAM</strong></p>\n<p>The Deployed AI team’s goal is twofold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build ambitious, high-quality agents with our most forward-leaning customers.</li>\n<li>Feed those learnings back into our product, platform, and agent tooling to raise the ceiling (and the floor) of what our customers can build on their own.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You’ll work closely with Field Engineering and Product to go from high-level customer goals to scoped agent architectures, implemented solutions, and live deployments. Along the way, you’ll uncover friction in our platform, identify common agent patterns, and contribute reusable abstractions (evaluators, tool integrations, routing logic, etc.) that make future agent development faster and better.</p>\n<p>You’ll also act as a trusted advisor to our customers, combining deep technical expertise with product intuition and business understanding. AI agents are not deterministic systems—they are probabilistic workflows with real-world consequences. Part of your role is helping customers deploy them responsibly, reliably, and with a clear understanding of the tradeoffs involved.</p>\n<p>This role is hybrid: part software engineering, part product thinking, part solution design. It’s also high leverage. The things you build and learn will directly shape the future of AI at Retool—both in the product and in the market.</p>\n<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL DO</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design and implement AI agents using Retool’s platform, working directly with strategic customers and our Field Engineering team</li>\n<li>Prototype and productionize integrations across APIs, data sources, and tools (e.g. Snowflake, Salesforce, Postgres, vector DBs, internal APIs)</li>\n<li>Tune and evaluate agent performance, balancing accuracy, determinism, latency, and user experience</li>\n<li>Deploy and maintain agents in production, with appropriate monitoring, guardrails, and fallback mechanisms</li>\n<li>Develop reusable building blocks for agent development—libraries, prompts, evaluators, workflows, etc.—that accelerate both internal and customer use cases</li>\n<li>Capture patterns and pain points to inform product development, and work closely with the Agents team to influence roadmap and features</li>\n<li>Partner with GTM and customers to scope and validate high-impact agent opportunities</li>\n<li>Evangelize best practices in AI engineering, helping customers (and Retool teammates) navigate the fast-moving world of LLMs, evals, and orchestration</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong software engineering background—comfortable writing production-quality code across the stack</li>\n<li>Experience with AI/ML systems, particularly LLM-based apps and architectures</li>\n<li>Deep curiosity about real-world problems and how to solve them with software</li>\n<li>Familiarity with one or more of the following:</li>\n<li>Prompt engineering</li>\n<li>LangChain / agent orchestration</li>\n<li>Retrieval-augmented generation</li>\n<li>Vector databases (e.g. Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)</li>\n<li>Toolformer, ReAct, or other reasoning patterns</li>\n<li>LLM evaluation techniques (e.g. human + model evals)</li>\n<li>Excellent communication skills—you’ll be working directly with technical and non-technical stakeholders across organizations</li>\n<li>Thrives in ambiguity and iteration; excited to invent new workflows and best practices where none yet exist</li>\n<li>5+ years experience in software engineering, ML engineering, or similar roles</li>\n<li>Demonstrated success in customer-facing or cross-functional technical roles</li>\n<li>Prior experience shipping LLM-based products or building AI apps is a strong plus</li>\n<li>Bachelor’s or advanced degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field</li>\n<li>Bonus: Experience working with Retool (apps, workflows, resources, components)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>HOW YOU'LL WORK</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reporting to the Head of Product for Agents</li>\n<li>Working closely with Field Engineering, Product, and Infrastructure teams</li>\n<li>Frequently interfacing with customers—both hands-on and in advisory roles</li>\n<li>Serving as a feedback loop for the core product, with a front-row view of what customers need and what AI makes possible</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>METRICS FOR SUCESS</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Successful launch and adoption of Retool agents at key strategic customers</li>\n<li>Agent usage, reliability, and performance in production</li>\n<li>Development of reusable agent patterns and solutions</li>\n<li>Influence on Retool’s agent roadmap and product direction</li>\n<li>Decreased time-to-value for customers deploying AI agents</li>\n<li>Quality and completeness of enablement materials (reference agents, templates, docs, etc.)</li>\n</ul><p>For candidates based in San Francisco, the pay range(s) for this role is listed below and represents base salary range for non-commissionable roles or on-target earnings (OTE) for commissionable roles.

Our mission is to protect our democracies. We aim to achieve technological leadership, so that open societies can continue to make sovereign decisions and control their ethical standards.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>As democracies, we believe we have a special responsibility to be thoughtful about the development and deployment of powerful technologies like AI. We take this responsibility seriously.</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>We are an ambitious and committed team of engineers, AI specialists and customer-facing program managers.<span> We are looking for mission-driven people to join our European teams – and apply their skills to solve the most complex and impactful problems. We embrace an open and transparent culture that welcomes healthy debates on the use of technology in defense, its benefits, and its ethical implications.</span><span> </span></span></p>\n\n<h2><strong>The role</strong></h2>\n\n<p>At Helsing we develop and deliver AI-based capabilities and the enabling infrastructure that allow <span>semi-autonomous platforms to localize, navigate</span>, and perceive the world in real time. We build software that is subject to significant and unorthodox technical constraints, must operate in a wide variety of constantly-changing environments, and has to support an ever-growing list of challenging use-cases. What we build ultimately ends up in the hands of real people in high-risk, high-stress situations, so <strong>must</strong> be both reliable and frictionless. Taken together, this brings a whole host of interesting engineering challenges across a wide variety of fields that you’ll help us solve. To give some <span>examples</span>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Distributed systems (e.g., intermittent connectivity and byzantine actors)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Embedded computing (e.g., resource-constrained compute and reverse-engineering)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Robotics (e.g., control systems and tasking)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Networking (e.g., long-range low-bandwidth radios and cross-medium routing)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deployment infrastructure (e.g., air-gapped devices and heterogenous fleets)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Security (e.g., data sharing in low-trust, no-TLS networks and actually-secret data handling)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Machine learning (e.g., systems for model development, storage, and dissemination)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In several of these areas, we are working near the state-of-the-art; we actively read (and sometimes implement) research papers, and often need to push even further to make theory work in practice. In others, we are applying well-known techniques to real-world situations (with real-world limitations) that have never been used in before, which requires skill, diligence, and honing a deep understanding of the underlying technologies.</p>\n\n<h2>The day-to-day</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Review code contributions, proposals, and RFCs from colleagues. At Helsing we strongly believe that unblocking others takes precedence over spending more time on your own work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Propose and implement new features, capabilities, algorithms, infrastructure, or even full products across our stack. We encourage our engineers to look beyond their immediate team for missed opportunities, and to <span>speak up</span> when they identify one</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Become a mentor, find a mentee, and help support and develop our interviewing pipeline. The people make or break the company, and we want as many engineers as possible to be part of fostering and growing the organization</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Share your experience and technical know-how with other Helsingers. We host tech talks, get together for smaller “let’s learn together” groups, run topical office hours (e.g., on Rust), etc. to help each other get better with time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintain our existing software stack, including working with internal and external customers to identify issues, improving operational reliability and performance, and fending off technical debt. The stack is a mix of Rust and Python, with Python mainly living in the ML-heavy sections</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Further develop our tests and benchmarks, both at the micro and macro level. We operate in a domain where robustness is of the utmost importance, and an extensive and ever-improving test suite is key to achieving that. And without thorough benchmarks, we would be flying blind</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Present your work at our weekly demo sessions. We want engineers to come together around what they are working on and to feel like they are not endlessly squirreling away at something that doesn’t matter. To that end, we host (and actively work towards) demo sessions that allow early feedback, celebration of progress, and a better shared understanding of everything that goes on at Helsing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>You should apply if you</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Can write legible, maintainable, and performant code</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communicate well in English, both verbally and in writing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enjoy collaborating with others, including reviewing code and pair programming</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are comfortable working asynchronously (writing PRs and RFCs, having discussions by email)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have backend development experience, ideally with a language like Rust, Java, Go, or C++</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are familiar with backend interface tools like REST, GraphQL, gRPC/Protocol Buffers, and Arrow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strive to improve yourself, your peers, and the culture you work in over time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feel like ethical considerations are an inherent part of engineering</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Nice to Have</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rust and Python specifically</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Container-based and cloud-native application architectures (e.g., Docker, Azure, AWS)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Metrics tooling (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>SQL and streaming database systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Routing protocols (e.g., IGP, BGP)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cryptographic protocols (e.g., Signal, WireGuard)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hardware interfaces (e.g., Arduino)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Robotics (e.g., control systems)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Production ML systems</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong><span>Join Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their fields</span><span> </span></strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Helsing’s work is important.

The department is founded on two pillars: a deep understanding of technology and AI, and methodological expertise rooted in STEM fields as well as other disciplines, such as the health sciences, social sciences, public policy, arts, and humanities. Its goal is to understand these technologies in their broader societal and human contexts, including their history, economics, and sociology. A special emphasis will be placed on the ethical dimensions and societal impacts of emerging technologies.</span></p>\n<p><span>The undergraduate and graduate programs emphasize human agency over and responsibility for technology, grounded in society’s needs. Students and researchers are encouraged to explore how technologies should be studied and how they may contribute to the good of communities. The program will attract students with interests and expertise in a wide range of fields to work collaboratively with fellow students and faculty from other fields across the university. They will become fully conversant with the technologies they study while benefiting from the intrinsically interdisciplinary nature of the degree programs.</span></p>\n<p><span>DTAS is housed in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University, a leading, R1, AAU-designated STEM institution. Through joint faculty appointments across the University, active programs and events, and partnerships with surrounding communities, industries, and policymakers, DTAS will serve as a hub for collaboration and interdisciplinarity. It will bring together students and scholars from the humanities, the social sciences, the arts, communication, medicine, science, and engineering.  DTAS will also interact with and benefit from other resources on campus, including the University’s AI Innovation Institute, the University Libraries AI Café, the Collaboratory for Earth, and the University’s partnerships with New York State’s Empire AI, the New York Climate Exchange, the Alda Center for Communicating Science, and other regional centers and initiatives. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Stony Brook University:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Stony Brook University, one of four research intensive campuses within the State University of New York (SUNY) system, is widely regarded as its flagship.

You’ll act like a founder inside the company: identifying problems, shipping code, driving adoption, and iterating quickly based on what you learn. This role blends engineering, product, operations, and business leadership—and is ideal for someone who has launched products, acquired users, and driven growth independently. You will work closely with our sales, onboarding, and account management teams to automate workflows, build better customer experiences, and unlock new growth.</p>\n<p>This role is inspired by best-in-class FDSEs at companies like Palantir and is perfect for builders who love solving real-world problems in the field, not from behind a desk.</p>\n<p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong><br>Work directly with users and internal teams to identify high-leverage problems and ship product solutions. Write production code (approximately 50% of your time) and ship weekly improvements across the customer journey. Use tools like Widesurf, Cursor, and other AI accelerators to increase your velocity and quality of output. Build and deploy AI-powered tooling that eliminates manual effort and improves the experience for providers, parents, and government partners. Automate onboarding flows, proposal generation, reporting processes, and other operational workflows. Own full loops: talk to users, design solutions, write code, test, deploy, and monitor adoption. Prioritize based on business impact and collaborate across teams to drive measurable results.</p>\n<p><strong>What Success Looks Like</strong><br>You uncover user pain points faster than anyone else and consistently ship solutions that address them. You deploy AI-infused internal tools or product experiences that improve core metrics (conversion, retention, revenue). You fully own feedback loops—from discovery to deployment—and iterate rapidly. Internal teams rely on your tools to operate faster and with fewer resources. You’re moving fast, staying close to the customer, and operating with very little hand-holding.</p>\n<p><strong>Who You Are</strong><br>A builder and founder at heart—you’ve started a company, built products that got users, or made revenue independently. Comfortable talking to users weekly and distilling insight into product decisions. Technical enough to ship production code on your own—experience with Python, JavaScript, or similar languages. Experienced using AI/LLMs and developer tools like Windsurf and Cursor to move faster and smarter. Business-minded—you’ve worked in consulting, managed a P&amp;L, or attended business school and know how to prioritize based on ROI. Comfortable operating in ambiguity and energized by a high-trust, high-impact, in-person environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Join Us</strong><br>Make a direct impact on families, small business owners, and communities. Operate with founder-like ownership on the company’s most important priorities. Join a small, fast-moving team with a bias for action.
